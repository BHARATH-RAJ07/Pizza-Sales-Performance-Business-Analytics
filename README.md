# Pizza Sales Analytics Dashboard
SQL | Python (Pandas, NumPy) | Power BI | Tableau

## Project Overview
This project analyzes transactional pizza sales data to uncover revenue trends, customer behavior, and product performance.
The objective is to support data-driven business decisions using SQL analysis, Python-based EDA, and interactive dashboards built in Power BI and Tableau.

The project follows an end-to-end analytics workflow, from raw data extraction to executive-level reporting.

## Business Objectives

- Identify top and bottom performing pizzas
- Understand customer purchasing behavior
- Analyze daily, hourly, weekly, and monthly trends
- Compare sales performance by pizza category and size
- Deliver interactive dashboards for decision-making

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Total Revenue
- Total Orders
- Total Pizzas Sold
- Average Order Value (AOV)
- Average Pizzas per Order

## Dataset Information
